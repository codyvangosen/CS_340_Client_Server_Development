# CS_340_Client_Server_Development
This repository includes my final portfolio for my SNHU course of CS 340 Client/Server Development.

How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

In Project One, I focused on creating maintainable, readable, and adaptable code when developing the CRUD Python module. By adhering to proper naming conventions, consistent formatting, and incorporating in-line comments, I ensured that the module would be easy to maintain and understand by future developers. This modular approach, particularly with the CRUD functionality, made it simple to integrate the database with the Grazioso Salvare dashboard in Project Two. Using object-oriented programming principles allowed the module to be flexible and reusable for future projects, with methods for creating, reading, updating, and deleting documents from MongoDB. The clear separation of each CRUD operation meant that it could easily be adapted for other databases or systems requiring similar functionality.

The advantage of this modularity became evident when connecting the CRUD operations to the dashboard in Project Two. I was able to efficiently manage database interactions, such as retrieving and displaying shelter data on the dashboard, without needing to rewrite core functionality. This same CRUD module could be repurposed for future projects, offering a strong foundation for database-driven applications.

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

When approaching problems in this project, I first broke down the requirements and focused on each core functionality: database design, CRUD operations, and dashboard integration. In Project One, I designed the MongoDB database schema to ensure it met Grazioso Salvareâ€™s requirements for organizing shelter data and querying for specific animal profiles. This was different from previous assignments in that it required handling unstructured data in a NoSQL environment, which demanded flexibility in data retrieval and updating.

In future projects, I will continue to prioritize schema design and database optimization based on client needs. For example, indexing and query optimization are essential to ensure performance in large-scale datasets. By analyzing user needs upfront and structuring the database accordingly, I can build more efficient systems that scale well over time.

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists play a critical role in helping companies optimize their operations through software solutions. In this case, my work with Grazioso Salvare allowed the organization to better identify and manage dogs for search-and-rescue training by providing them with an interactive dashboard connected to a robust database. The CRUD operations ensured that the data remained accurate and up-to-date, while the dashboard offered a user-friendly interface for querying and visualizing the data.

This type of project highlights the importance of data-driven applications, enabling companies like Grazioso Salvare to make informed decisions that improve efficiency and outcomes. By organizing and presenting data in a meaningful way, computer scientists help organizations leverage their data to solve real-world problems.
